# Search Dictionary Faster
## summary
Every times it's boring to search words with copy and paste. I found out several dictionary site URLs, I made this tool let us to go directly to the dictionary site. And I noticed I always searched same words. So it saves history data to study later.

## Description
### Link list
When you select a text, Link list is displayed. Link list is list of your favorite dictionary sites. When ESC key is pressed or mouse is clicked outside the area of Link list, Link list is closed. You can change Link list to small icon button, also change display mode to automatic or manual. So I'm careful not to disturb normal browsing.

### Context menu(right click)
Link list is also displayed in the context menu. So you can use without changing your experience. And you can change display mode to automatic or manual in here.

### Make Link list
On the Setting screen you have to make your Link list. And you have to find out URLs and search parameters. But I already found out main site URLs and search parameters. It's prepared in this tool. So you can use this tool immediately.

### History
On the Setting screen you can watch history. A word with a high number of searches is that your understanding is not sufficient although it is used frequently. You should study it intensively. To find the word efficiently, a function is built in to aggregate search counts.

### About preset URLs
URLs and search parameters of the following sites are prepared. If these specifications are changed by the site administrator, we need to change too. If you want to add some URLs, please email me. There may be people who need it too.

* Google
* bing
* DuckDuckGo
* 百度
* Wikipedia
* Cambridge Dictionary
* Oxford Dictionaries
* Collins
* weblio 辞書
* goo 辞書

etc. Total 71 URLs.
