## Summary
When you read a foreign language website, this supports to search words. When you select a word, Widget is displayed that show the meaning of the word and show some links to search the word. There is also a function to save history and support word review.

## Description
### Widget
When you select some words on the website, Widget is displayed. When ESC key is pressed or mouse is clicked outside the area of Widget, it closes Widget. On the setting screen, you can change small icon button instead of Widget, and also change Widget layout. On context menu(right click), you can change display way either automatic or manual.

### Links
When click a link in Widget, it opens the website to search the word selected. You can customize these links to your favorite website. The links are also displayed on context menu(right click).

### Wiktionary linkage
Wiktionary is a dictionary website made by volunteers. When you select some word, it's sent to Wiktinary for search and the description is displayed.

### History, Find weak point
On the setting screen you can view history. The word with a high number of searches is that used frequently, and you don't remember well. To find the word efficiently, there is a function(Find weak point) to aggregate search counts.

### About link edit
Generally you have to find out URLs and search parameters, but I already found out major website URLs and search parameters. So immediately you can use it, if you are not familiar with internet technology. If these specifications are changed by the website administrator, we also need to change. If you want to add some URLs, please request me. There is probably another people who need it too.
