# Search Dictionary Faster
## summary
Every times it's boring to search words with copy and paste. I found out several dictinary site URLs, I made this tool let us to go directly to the dictionary site. And I noticed I always searched same words. So it saves history data to study later.

## Description
### Link list
When you select a text, a Link list is dsiplayed. the Link list is list of your favorite dictionary sites or search engines. When ESC key is pressed or mouse is clicked outside the area of the Link list, the Link list is closed. You can change the Link list to small icon button, display automatically or manually. I'm careful not to disturb normal browsing.

### Context menu(right click)
the Link list is displayed in the context menu too. So you start without changing user experience. Here you can switch between automatic display and manual display of the Linked list.

### Setting screen
On the Setting screen you have to make your Link list. And you have to find out URLs and search parameters. But I already found out main site URLs and search parameters and prepared it. So you can use this tool immediately. When you use the Link list, the history data is saved. The history data are used to aggregate search count each words you searched. A word with a high number of searches is a word that your understanding is not sufficient although it is used frequently. You would study the word more. the history data is not affected by browser sync service.

### About preset URLs
URLs and search parameters of the following sites are prepared. If these specification are changed by the site administorator, we needs to change too. If you want to add some URLs, please email me. There may be people who need it too.
